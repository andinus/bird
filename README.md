# Bird üê¶

Bird - Alternative to Chef Inspec Written in Raku.

It's written in Raku and exposes pure Raku API.

# WARNING ‚ö†Ô∏è

Bird is under active development now, things might change.

# Build Status

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/melezhik/bird.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/melezhik/bird)

# INSTALL

    zef install Bird

Bird uses Sparrow6 plugin `ssh-bulk-check` to do it's work, so one needs
to setup Sparrow6 repository:

    export SP6_REPO=http://sparrowhub.io/repo

To run check remotely install ssh-pass:

    sudo yum install sshpass

# USAGE

Create rules:

`cat rules.pl6`

    directory-exists "{%*ENV<HOME>}";

    file-exists "{%*ENV<HOME>}/.bashrc";

    bash "echo hello > /tmp/bird.tmp";

    bash "echo bird >> /tmp/bird.tmp";

    file-has-line "/tmp/bird.tmp", "hello", "bird";

    file-has-permission "documentation/dsl.md", %( read-all => True );
    file-has-permission "bin/bird", %( execute-all => True, read-all => True );

    bash "chmod a+r /tmp/bird.tmp";

    bash "chmod a+w /tmp/bird.tmp";

    file-has-permission "/tmp/bird.tmp", %( write-all => True, read-all => True );

    command-has-stdout "echo hello; echo bird", "hello", "bird";

    command-exit-code "raku --version", 0;

    package-installed "nano";

    pip3-package-installed "PyYAML";

    file-has-permission "rules.pl6", %( read-all => True );

    package-installed "nano";

    bash "echo username=admin > /tmp/creds.txt; echo password=123 >> /tmp/creds.txt;";

    file-data-not-empty "/tmp/creds.txt",
      "username=", "password=";

Run checks against hosts:

`bird`

```

# Rules DSL

Rules DSL is special language to validate states of Linux host.

This is just plain Raku functions:

    file-exists "{%*ENV<HOME>}/.bashrc";

The full list of DSL functions available [here](https://github.com/melezhik/bird/blob/master/documentation/dsl.md).

# Ssh hosts

There are two ways to set ssh hosts:

## Command line

By using `--host`, `--user`, `--password` options:

    bird --host=192.168.0.1 --user=alex --password=PasSword

## Hosts.pl6

To define dynamic hosts configuration, use `hosts.pl6`, this should
be Raku script that returns `@Array` of hosts:

    [
      '192.168.0.1',
      'foo.bar.baz',
      # so on
    ]

For example:

    use Sparrow6::DSL;

    my %state = task-run "worker nodes", "ambari-hosts", %(
      ambari_host  => 'cluster.fqdn.host',
      admin => 'super-jack',
      password => 'PaSsWord123',
      cluster => "cluster01",
      node_type => "worker",
    );

    %state<hosts><>.map: { %i<ip> }

# cli options

* `--rules`

Path to rules file. If not set `rules.pl` in cwd is taken


* `--password`

Ssh password. Optional

* `--user`

Ssh user. Optional

* `--host`

Ssh host. Optional, see also `hosts.pl6`

* `--verbose`

Verbose mode. Not used now. Reserved for the future
